Side B
Pin		Direction		Designation		Description
B1		Input			Left Audio		Audio sourced from cartridge, left channel, mixed into output.
B2		Output			/MRES			Master reset, from system start up.
B3		Input			Right Audio		Audio sourced from cartridge, right channel, mixed into output.
B4		Output			Address Bit 9	 
B5		Output			Address Bit 10	 
B6		Output			Address Bit 18	 
B7		Output			Address Bit 19	 
B8		Output			Address Bit 20	 
B9		Output			Address Bit 21	 
B10		Output			Address Bit 22	 
B11		Output			Address Bit 23	 
B12		Output			/YS				VDP is currently drawing the backdrop colour.
B13		Output			/VSYNC			Vertical sync pulse.
B14		Output			/HSYNC			Horizonal sync pulse.
B15		Output			EDCLK			External Dot Clock (~13.4 or 10.7 MHz).
B16		Output			/CAS0			Read or Write on $000000-$DFFFFF region.
B17		Output			/CEO			Chip Enable for the cartridge. Normally low when accessing $000000-$3FFFFF region.  When expension unit is present then low when accessing $400000-$7FFFFF.
B18		Output			/AS				Address strobe, address on bus is currently valid and not changing.
B19		Output			VCLK			68K Clock
B20		Input			/DTACK			Data acknowledge to 68K.
B21		Output			/CAS2			Read or Write on $E00000-$FFFFFF region, maybe (Upper 2MB).
B22		Output / Input	Data Bit 15	 
B23		Output / Input	Data Bit 14	 
B24		Output / Input	Data Bit 13	 
B25		Output / Input	Data Bit 12	 
B26		Output			/ASEL			Read or Write on $000000-$7FFFFF region
B27		Output			/VRES			System reset, from front panel switch.
B28		Output			/LWR			Lower byte WRite, the lower byte on the data lines should be written to the location in the address lines.
B29		Output			/UWR			Upper byte WRite, the upper byte on the data lines should be written to the location in the address lines.
B30		Input			/M3				Pulled high in console, cartridge shorts to ground to indicate console should run in Mark 3 (Master System) mode.
B31		Output			/TIME			Set for r/w at/to $A13000-$A130FF, given the name suggests it might be for a real time clock in the cartridge. This would enable usage as a chip enable on a RTC, using fewer address lines or logic to that RTC. Used in Sonic 3 for SRAM.
B32		Input			/CART			Pulled high in console, cartridge shorts to ground to indicate presence.
